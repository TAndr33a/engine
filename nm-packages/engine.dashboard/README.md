# @c11/engine.dashboard

## Usage

See the up-to-date documentation:
[https://code11.github.io/engine/docs/packages/dashboard](https://code11.github.io/engine/docs/packages/dashboard)

## Development

Run `yarn start` in `/packages/engine.dashboard`.

This will start the dashboard using it's own app-structure.json.
This makes it easy to debug while developing.
